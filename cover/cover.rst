**HISTORY**

The original version of this set of the computer programs "PHASE" was
developed by the members of the Theory Group of Joint Research Center
for Atom Technology (JRCAT), based in Tsukuba, in the period 1993-2001.
The names of the contributors to the original version are Hideki
Katagiri, K. Kato, T. Miyazaki, Y. Morikawa, H. Sawada, T. Uchiyama, T.
Uda and T. Yamasaki. These contributors has agreed with that the

distributes this program as a free software.

Since 2002, this program set had been intensively developed as a part of
the following national projects supported by the Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; "Frontier
Simulation Software for Industrial Science (FSIS)" from 2002 to 2005,
"Revolutionary Simulation Software (RSS21)" from 2006 to 2008. "Research
and Development of Innovative Simulation Software (RISS)" from 2008 to
2013. These projects is lead by the Center for Research on Innovative
Simulation Software (CISS), the Institute of Industrial Science (IIS),
the University of Tokyo.

Since 2013, this program set has been further developed centering on
PHASE System Consortium.

The activity of development of this program set has been supervised by
Takahisa Ohno.
